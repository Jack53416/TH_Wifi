*Temperature-humidity sensor*

### To do for v0.2:
- [x] Enhancing measurement storage ( 500 is very small for that type of device)
- [x] Optimizing the send procedure for larger storage
- [ ] Proper config mode that cooperates with android
- [ ] Comments in the code/documentation
- [ ] Cleaning the obsolete code that is no longer in use
